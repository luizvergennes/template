## Runtime & Tooling

### Bun

Default to using Bun instead of Node.js.

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` or `ts-node <file>`.
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`.
- Use `bun build <file.html|file.ts|file.css>` instead of `webpack` or `esbuild`.
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install`, `yarn install`, or `pnpm install`.
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>`, `yarn run <script>`, or `pnpm run <script>`.
- Use `bunx <package> <command>` instead of `npx <package> <command>`.
- Bun automatically loads `.env`, so don't use `dotenv`.

For more information, read the Bun API docs in `node_modules/bun-types/docs/**.mdx`.

### Ultracite (lint & format)

This project uses **Ultracite**, a zero-config preset powered by Biome. Most issues are automatically fixable.

| Task                | Command                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Format code         | `bun x ultracite fix`  |
| Check for issues    | `bun x ultracite check`|
| Diagnose setup      | `bun x ultracite doctor`|

Run `bun x ultracite fix` before committing.

#### When Biome can't help

Biome catches syntax and style. Focus your own attention on:

1. **Business logic correctness** — Biome can't validate algorithms.
2. **Meaningful naming** — descriptive names for functions, variables, and types.
3. **Architecture decisions** — component structure, data flow, API design.
4. **Edge cases** — boundary conditions and error states.
5. **User experience** — accessibility, performance, usability.
6. **Documentation** — comments for complex logic; prefer self-documenting code.

## Framework Notes

### Next.js: always read docs before coding

Before any Next.js work, find and read the relevant doc in `apps/web/node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Your training data is outdated — the docs are the source of truth.

### Next.js conventions

- Use the `<Image>` component for images, not `<img>`.
- Use `next/head` or the App Router metadata API for head elements.
- Use Server Components for async data fetching instead of async Client Components.

### React 19+

- Use `ref` as a prop instead of `React.forwardRef`.

## Code Standards

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Prefer clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Type safety & explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity.
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown.
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types.
- Lean on TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions.
- Replace magic numbers with named constants.

### Modern JavaScript & TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions.
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops.
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access.
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation.
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments.
- `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`.

### Async & promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions — don't drop the return value.
- Use `async/await` over promise chains.
- Handle errors meaningfully with `try/catch`.
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors.

### React & JSX

- Use function components, not class components.
- Call hooks at the top level only, never conditionally.
- Specify all dependencies correctly in hook dependency arrays.
- Use the `key` prop for elements in iterables — prefer unique IDs over array indices.
- Nest children between opening and closing tags instead of passing them as props.
- Don't define components inside other components.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes:
  - Provide meaningful `alt` text for images.
  - Use a proper heading hierarchy.
  - Label form inputs.
  - Include keyboard handlers alongside mouse handlers.
  - Use semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, …) instead of divs with roles.

### Error handling & debugging

- Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` statements from production code.
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages — never strings or other values.
- Use `try/catch` meaningfully; don't catch just to rethrow.
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases.

### Code organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity.
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables.
- Use early returns to reduce nesting.
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternaries.
- Group related code; separate unrelated concerns.

### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links.
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary.
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`.
- Validate and sanitize user input.

### Performance

- Avoid spread syntax in accumulators inside loops.
- Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them inside loops.
- Prefer specific imports over namespace imports.
- Avoid barrel files (index files that re-export everything).
- Use proper image components (e.g. Next.js `<Image>`) over `<img>`.

## Testing

This project follows **test-driven development (TDD)**. Write the test before the code.

### The TDD cycle

1. **Red** — Write a small, failing test that describes one piece of desired behavior. Run it and watch it fail for the *right* reason (not a typo, not a missing import).
2. **Green** — Write the minimum code needed to make the test pass. Resist adding anything the test doesn't require.
3. **Refactor** — Clean up the code and the test with the safety net of a passing suite. Keep changes small and reversible.

Tests are the specification. A behavior not covered by a test is not guaranteed to work. Bug fixes start with a regression test that fails *because of the bug* — then the fix makes it pass.

### No mocking of internal code

Mocks drift from the real implementations they impersonate. Tests stay green while production breaks. This project avoids mocking as a default.

- **Internal collaborators** — call the real function, instantiate the real class. If a unit is hard to test without mocking its dependencies, that's a design signal: split the unit or inject simpler seams instead of reaching for a mock.
- **Database** — use the real PostgreSQL instance from `packages/db/docker-compose.yml` for any DB-backed test. Isolate tests with transactions that roll back at the end, or a schema-per-test strategy. Do **not** mock Drizzle or the underlying pg client.
- **HTTP between our own code** — call the real handler/route directly, or spin up the same Next.js route handler used in production. Do **not** mock `fetch` for endpoints we own.
- **True external boundaries only** — third-party APIs we don't control, the system clock, randomness, the filesystem when IO is not the subject of the test — may use a minimal test double. Prefer a hand-written fake that exercises the same contract over an ad-hoc mock library, and inject the dependency so the fake slots in without monkey-patching.

If you feel you *must* mock internal code, stop and reconsider the design first.

### Runner & example

Use `bun test` with `bun:test`:

```ts
// index.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hello world", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

### Test hygiene

- Write assertions inside `it()` or `test()` blocks.
- Use `async/await` in async tests — no done callbacks.
- Never commit `.only` or `.skip`.
- Keep suites reasonably flat — avoid excessive `describe` nesting.
- Prefer one behavior per test; name the test after the behavior, not the function under test.
